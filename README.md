Welcome to cheali-charger!
==========================

This project is an alternative firmware to a variety of lipo chargers,  
see [hardware.](README.md#hardware)

Don't use it if You don't need to  
(not everything is implemented yet).  

Any feedback is very welcome!

WARNING
-------
Please [CALIBRATE](README.md#calibration) charger before use!  
Use an external temperature probe  
(if You like your house ;) )

**ALWAYS** connect the power supply **first**, then the battery!

**ALWAYS** disconnect the battery **before** disconnecting the power supply!

- ... others, do your research or ask on the forum

Usage:
------

After [flashing](docs/flashing.md) your charger the first thing you should do is to 
reset the charger to its default settings ("options"->"reset default")
and then [calibrate](README.md#calibration) it, now your charger is ready to use.

programming you charger:
- select a free battery slot (indicated as 1., 2.,...)
- go to "edit battery"
 - change battery type "Bat:"
 - set battery voltage (number of cells) "V:"
 - set battery capacity "Ch:"
 - set charge current "Ic:"
 - set discharge current "Id:"
 - set time limit "Tlim:" (can be unlimited)
 - press "create name"

charing/discharging...:
- select battery
- select program: "charge", "discharge"...
- you should see a "info" screen,  
  (if you hear beeps, check your battery connections)
- hold "start" button for 2s to start the program
- charger is working now, press "inc", "dec" to see more screens
- to exit the program press "stop"

[Flashing](docs/flashing.md)
----------------------------

Calibration
-----------
Connect a NOT fully charged LiPo battery to the main leads  
and the balance port, if you don't own a battery with a  
balance connector, just connect a regular one (~4V)  
to the main leads and the balance port first two [pins](docs/connectors/balancePortPins.jpeg)  
(pin "0" <--> Bat-, pin "1" <--> Bat+). 

go to: "options"->"calibrate":
- voltage calibration: go to "voltage"
   - use a voltmeter to measure voltage on all cells and the power supply voltage (Vin)  
     and set voltage on Vin, Vb1, Vb2, .., Vb6  
      - only Vb1 is mandatory, battery main leads and balance port must be connected
      - you need to change at least one value (this will copy V1-6 voltage to Vbat)
- charge current calibration: 
  - connect your amperemeter in series with the battery, use the 10A(20A) input  
  - disconnect balance port
  - go to "I charge"  
    - go to: "50mA" (100mA on some versions)  
      press "start" button (current flow should be visible on amperemeter)  
      press "Inc", "Dec" buttons until the amperemeter shows 50mA (100mA on some versions)  
      press "start" button to save the setting  
    - go to: "1000mA"  
      press "start" button  
      press "Inc", "Dec" buttons until the amperemeter shows 1000mA  
      press "start" button to save the setting  
      WARNING: the battery will be charged with high current!
- discharge current calibration: go to "I discharge"  
    Repeat the same steps as before  
    WARNING: the battery will be discharged with high current!
- when needed: external (or internal) temperature probe calibration: go to "temp extern" ("temp intern")
    You have to set two calibration points

Done.  
If you have any problems with calibration, go to "options"->"reset default" and try again.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. After flashing I see "options" and some strange characters in the second line (for example: squares), what should I do?
    - reset the charger to default settings (go to: "options"->"reset default" and press the "start" button)
2. I get **"calib. error"**: see [this.](docs/calibration_error_codes.md)
3. Occasionally when the power is turned on, the error "eeprom error: 2 yes" pops up (or any other number): see [#291](https://github.com/stawel/cheali-charger/issues/291)
4. After flashing charger doesn't work (display shows squares):
    - download the *.hex again, use the "RAW" button in github
    - check the sha1 sum of the file, compare it with *.sha1:
      - linux: $sha1sum cheali-charger*.hex
      - windows: install [Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11533)
        - in cmd.exe: fciv.exe -sha1 -add cheali-charger-*.hex
5. [Atmega32 CPU] Sha1 sum is correct and the charger still doesn't work (display shows squares):
    - reset atmega32 fuses using avrdude:
      - windows: avrdude.exe -patmega32 -cusbasp -Uhfuse:w:0xc5:m -Ulfuse:w:0x3f:m
      - linux:   avrdude     -patmega32 -cusbasp -Uhfuse:w:0xc5:m -Ulfuse:w:0x3f:m
